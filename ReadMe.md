 # Steps of the musical toy project
 - At first install all of needy packages(vite,react,router-dom,bootstrap,firebase,vercel etc).And set up all routes
 - Then create a home page with some relevent section(musical toy related) for toy marketplace type site. Here I made musical toy site.Then set up firebase for authntication system(login,registration).
 - Then create a folder for backend server.There install some node packages like express,dotenv,cors.Then create an index file for creating server connection to client.
 - The most important thing is to use mongo db database here.At first set up and install this and make connection to the backend server.Then make some API's for showing data dynamically in the client side.
 - Next In this site one of most important work is CRUD(Create,Read,Update,Delete) operation through mongo db.After that use vercel production link for using as a server.Then fetch data dynamically to the client.Finally deploy this site on netlify and created a live site link.
